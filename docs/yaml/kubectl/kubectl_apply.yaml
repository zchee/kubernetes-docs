synopsis: Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin
description: "Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin. The resource
  name must be specified. This resource will be created if it doesn't exist yet. To
  use 'apply', always create the resource initially with either 'apply' or 'create
  --save-config'. \n\nJSON and YAML formats are accepted. \n\nAlpha Disclaimer: the
  --prune functionality is not yet complete. Do not use unless you are aware of what
  the current state is. See https://issues.k8s.io/34274."
options:
- name: all
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Select all resources in the namespace of the specified resource types.
- name: allow-missing-template-keys
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
- name: cascade
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, cascade the deletion of the resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController).  Default true.
- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: that contains the configuration to apply
- name: force
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Only used when grace-period=0. If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.
- name: grace-period
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion).
- name: include-uninitialized
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the kubectl command applies to uninitialized objects. If explicitly set to false, this flag overrides other flags that make the kubectl commands apply to uninitialized objects, e.g., "--all". Objects with empty metadata.initializers are regarded as initialized.
- name: openapi-patch
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, use openapi to calculate diff when the openapi presents and the resource can be found in the openapi spec. Otherwise, fall back to use baked-in types.
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-file.
- name: overwrite
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    Automatically resolve conflicts between the modified and live configuration by using values from the modified configuration
- name: prune
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Automatically delete resource objects, including the uninitialized ones, that do not appear in the configs and are created by either apply or create --save-config. Should be used with either -l or --all.
- name: prune-whitelist
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Overwrite the default whitelist with <group/version/kind> for --prune
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: selector
  shorthand: l
  usage: |
    Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
- name: server-dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, request will be sent to server with dry-run flag, which means the modifications won't be persisted. This is an alpha feature and flag.
- name: template
  usage: |
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
- name: timeout
  default_value: 0s
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
- name: validate
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, use a schema to validate the input before sending it
- name: wait
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers.
inherited_options:
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: as-group
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
- name: cache-dir
  default_value: /Users/zchee/.kube/http-cache
  usage: Default HTTP cache directory
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace

  usage: Name of the file to write the profile to
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server

example: "  # Apply the configuration in pod.json to a pod.\n  kubectl apply -f ./pod.json\n
  \ \n  # Apply the JSON passed into stdin to a pod.\n  cat pod.json | kubectl apply
  -f -\n  \n  # Note: --prune is still in Alpha\n  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml
  that matches label app=nginx and delete all the other resources that are not in
  the file and match label app=nginx.\n  kubectl apply --prune -f manifest.yaml -l
  app=nginx\n  \n  # Apply the configuration in manifest.yaml and delete all the other
  configmaps that are not in the file.\n  kubectl apply --prune -f manifest.yaml --all
  --prune-whitelist=core/v1/ConfigMap"
