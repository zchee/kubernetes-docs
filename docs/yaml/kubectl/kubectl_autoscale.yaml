name: autoscale
synopsis: |
  Auto-scale a Deployment, ReplicaSet, or ReplicationController
description: "Creates an autoscaler that automatically chooses and sets the number
  of pods that run in a kubernetes cluster. \n\nLooks up a Deployment, ReplicaSet,
  StatefulSet, or ReplicationController by name and creates an autoscaler that uses
  the given resource as a reference. An autoscaler can automatically increase or decrease
  number of pods deployed within the system as needed."
options:
- name: allow-missing-template-keys
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
- name: cpu-percent
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The target average CPU utilization (represented as a percent of requested CPU) over all the pods. If it's not specified or negative, a default autoscaling policy will be used.
- name: dry-run
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, only print the object that would be sent, without sending it.
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to autoscale.
- name: generator
  default_value: horizontalpodautoscaler/v1
  usage: |
    The name of the API generator to use. Currently there is only 1 generator.
- name: max
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The upper limit for the number of pods that can be set by the autoscaler. Required.
- name: min
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    The lower limit for the number of pods that can be set by the autoscaler. If it's not specified or negative, the server will apply a default value.
- name: name
  usage: |
    The name for the newly created object. If not specified, the name of the input resource will be used.
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-file.
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: save-config
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
- name: template
  usage: |
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
inherited_options:
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: as-group
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
- name: cache-dir
  default_value: /Users/zchee/.kube/http-cache
  usage: Default HTTP cache directory
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: profile
  default_value: none
  usage: |
    Name of profile to capture. One of (none|cpu|heap|goroutine|threadcreate|block|mutex)
- name: profile-output
  default_value: profile.pprof
  usage: Name of the file to write the profile to
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
example: "  # Auto scale a deployment \"foo\", with the number of pods between 2 and
  10, no target CPU utilization specified so a default autoscaling policy will be
  used:\n  kubectl autoscale deployment foo --min=2 --max=10\n  \n  # Auto scale a
  replication controller \"foo\", with the number of pods between 1 and 5, target
  CPU utilization at 80%:\n  kubectl autoscale rc foo --max=5 --cpu-percent=80"
