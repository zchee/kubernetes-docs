synopsis: Replace a resource by filename or stdin
description: "Replace a resource by filename or stdin. \n\nJSON and YAML formats are
  accepted. If replacing an existing resource, the complete resource spec must be
  provided. This can be obtained by \n\n  $ kubectl get TYPE NAME -o yaml\n  \nPlease
  refer to the models in https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/HEAD/docs/api-reference/v1/definitions.html

options:
- name: allow-missing-template-keys
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
- name: cascade
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, cascade the deletion of the resources managed by this resource (e.g. Pods created by a ReplicationController).  Default true.
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: to use to replace the resource.
- name: force
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Only used when grace-period=0. If true, immediately remove resources from API and bypass graceful deletion. Note that immediate deletion of some resources may result in inconsistency or data loss and requires confirmation.
- name: grace-period
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    Period of time in seconds given to the resource to terminate gracefully. Ignored if negative. Set to 1 for immediate shutdown. Can only be set to 0 when --force is true (force deletion).
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|name|template|go-template|go-template-file|templatefile|jsonpath-file|jsonpath.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: save-config
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the configuration of current object will be saved in its annotation. Otherwise, the annotation will be unchanged. This flag is useful when you want to perform kubectl apply on this object in the future.
- name: template
  usage: |
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
- name: timeout
  default_value: 0s
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a delete, zero means determine a timeout from the size of the object
- name: validate
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, use a schema to validate the input before sending it
- name: wait
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, wait for resources to be gone before returning. This waits for finalizers.
inherited_options:
- name: alsologtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error as well as files
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: as-group
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.

  default_value: /Users/zchee/.kube/http-cache
  usage: Default HTTP cache directory
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority

  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster

- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: log-backtrace-at
  default_value: :0
  usage: when logging hits line file:N, emit a stack trace
- name: log-dir
  usage: If non-empty, write log files in this directory
- name: logtostderr
  default_value: "false"
  usage: log to standard error instead of files
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: stderrthreshold
  default_value: "2"
  usage: logs at or above this threshold go to stderr
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
- name: v
  shorthand: v
  default_value: "0"
  usage: log level for V logs
- name: vmodule
  usage: |
    comma-separated list of pattern=N settings for file-filtered logging
example: "  # Replace a pod using the data in pod.json.\n  kubectl replace -f ./pod.json\n
  \ \n  # Replace a pod based on the JSON passed into stdin.\n  cat pod.json | kubectl
  replace -f -\n  \n  # Update a single-container pod's image version (tag) to v4\n
  \ kubectl get pod mypod -o yaml | sed 's/\\(image: myimage\\):.*$/\\1:v4/' | kubectl
  replace -f -\n  \n  # Force replace, delete and then re-create the resource\n  kubectl
  replace --force -f ./pod.json"
