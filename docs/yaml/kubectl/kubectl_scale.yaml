name: scale
synopsis: |
  Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller, or Job
description: "Set a new size for a Deployment, ReplicaSet, Replication Controller,
  or StatefulSet. \n\nScale also allows users to specify one or more preconditions
  for the scale action. \n\nIf --current-replicas or --resource-version is specified,
  it is validated before the scale is attempted, and it is guaranteed that the precondition
  holds true when the scale is sent to the server."
options:
- name: all
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Select all resources in the namespace of the specified resource types
- name: allow-missing-template-keys
  default_value: "true"
  usage: |
    If true, ignore any errors in templates when a field or map key is missing in the template. Only applies to golang and jsonpath output formats.
- name: current-replicas
  default_value: "-1"
  usage: |
    Precondition for current size. Requires that the current size of the resource match this value in order to scale.
- name: filename
  shorthand: f
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Filename, directory, or URL to files identifying the resource to set a new size
- name: output
  shorthand: o
  usage: |
    Output format. One of: json|yaml|name|go-template|go-template-file|template|templatefile|jsonpath|jsonpath-file.
- name: record
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Record current kubectl command in the resource annotation. If set to false, do not record the command. If set to true, record the command. If not set, default to updating the existing annotation value only if one already exists.
- name: recursive
  shorthand: R
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    Process the directory used in -f, --filename recursively. Useful when you want to manage related manifests organized within the same directory.
- name: replicas
  default_value: "0"
  usage: The new desired number of replicas. Required.
- name: resource-version
  usage: |
    Precondition for resource version. Requires that the current resource version match this value in order to scale.
- name: selector
  shorthand: l
  usage: |
    Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
- name: template
  usage: |
    Template string or path to template file to use when -o=go-template, -o=go-template-file. The template format is golang templates [http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/#pkg-overview].
- name: timeout
  default_value: 0s
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a scale operation, zero means don't wait. Any other values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h).
inherited_options:
- name: as
  usage: Username to impersonate for the operation
- name: as-group
  default_value: '[]'
  usage: |
    Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
- name: cache-dir
  default_value: /Users/zchee/.kube/http-cache
  usage: Default HTTP cache directory
- name: certificate-authority
  usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
- name: client-certificate
  usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
- name: client-key
  usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
- name: cluster
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
- name: context
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig context to use
- name: insecure-skip-tls-verify
  default_value: "false"
  usage: |
    If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
- name: kubeconfig
  usage: Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
- name: match-server-version
  default_value: "false"
  usage: Require server version to match client version
- name: namespace
  shorthand: "n"
  usage: If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
- name: profile
  default_value: none
  usage: |
    Name of profile to capture. One of (none|cpu|heap|goroutine|threadcreate|block|mutex)
- name: profile-output
  default_value: profile.pprof
  usage: Name of the file to write the profile to
- name: request-timeout
  default_value: "0"
  usage: |
    The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
- name: server
  shorthand: s
  usage: The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
- name: token
  usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
- name: user
  usage: The name of the kubeconfig user to use
example: "  # Scale a replicaset named 'foo' to 3.\n  kubectl scale --replicas=3 rs/foo\n
  \ \n  # Scale a resource identified by type and name specified in \"foo.yaml\" to
  3.\n  kubectl scale --replicas=3 -f foo.yaml\n  \n  # If the deployment named mysql's
  current size is 2, scale mysql to 3.\n  kubectl scale --current-replicas=2 --replicas=3
  deployment/mysql\n  \n  # Scale multiple replication controllers.\n  kubectl scale
  --replicas=5 rc/foo rc/bar rc/baz\n  \n  # Scale statefulset named 'web' to 3.\n
  \ kubectl scale --replicas=3 statefulset/web"
