## kubectl port-forward

Forward one or more local ports to a pod

### Synopsis

Forward one or more local ports to a pod. 

Use resource type/name such as deployment/mydeployment to select a pod. Resource type defaults to 'pod' if omitted. 

If there are multiple pods matching the criteria, a pod will be selected automatically. The forwarding session ends when the selected pod terminates, and rerun of the command is needed to resume forwarding.

```
kubectl port-forward TYPE/NAME [options] [LOCAL_PORT:]REMOTE_PORT [...[LOCAL_PORT_N:]REMOTE_PORT_N]
```

### Examples

```
  # Listen on ports 5000 and 6000 locally, forwarding data to/from ports 5000 and 6000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward pod/mypod 5000 6000
  
  # Listen on ports 5000 and 6000 locally, forwarding data to/from ports 5000 and 6000 in a pod selected by the deployment
  kubectl port-forward deployment/mydeployment 5000 6000
  
  # Listen on ports 5000 and 6000 locally, forwarding data to/from ports 5000 and 6000 in a pod selected by the service
  kubectl port-forward service/myservice 5000 6000
  
  # Listen on port 8888 locally, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward pod/mypod 8888:5000
  
  # Listen on port 8888 on all addresses, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 pod/mypod 8888:5000
  
  # Listen on port 8888 on localhost and selected IP, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward --address localhost,10.19.21.23 pod/mypod 8888:5000
  
  # Listen on a random port locally, forwarding to 5000 in the pod
  kubectl port-forward pod/mypod :5000
