  /admin                     Generates a kubeconfig file for the admin to use and for kubeadm itself
  /kubelet                   Generates a kubeconfig file for the kubelet to use *only* for cluster bootstrapping purposes
  /controller\-manager        Generates a kubeconfig file for the controller manager to use
  /scheduler                 Generates a kubeconfig file for the scheduler to use
control\-plane              Generates all static Pod manifest files necessary to establish the control plane
  /apiserver                 Generates the kube\-apiserver static Pod manifest
  /controller\-manager        Generates the kube\-controller\-manager static Pod manifest
  /scheduler                 Generates the kube\-scheduler static Pod manifest
etcd                       Generates static Pod manifest file for local etcd.
  /local                     Generates the static Pod manifest file for a local, single\-node local etcd instance.
upload\-config              Uploads the kubeadm and kubelet configuration to a ConfigMap
  /kubeadm                   Uploads the kubeadm ClusterConfiguration to a ConfigMap
  /kubelet                   Uploads the kubelet component config to a ConfigMap
mark\-control\-plane         Mark a node as a control\-plane
bootstrap\-token            Generates bootstrap tokens used to join a node to a cluster
addon                      Installs required addons for passing Conformance tests
